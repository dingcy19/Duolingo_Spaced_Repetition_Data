# Duolingo Spaced Repetition Data

This repository contains the final report for a course assignment, based on an
analysis of large-scale Duolingo learning data.

## Contents
- `Duolingo_Report.pdf`: Final version of the assignment report.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to reproduce the analysis.

## Environment
The analysis was conducted in Python. The computational environment is specified
in `requirements.txt`, which lists the external libraries used in this project.
(Two environment specifications are provided: `requirements.txt` (pip-based)
and `environment.yml` (conda-based). Either can be used to recreate the
computational environment.)
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
